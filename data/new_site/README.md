This is my site.


Instructions
------------

 1. Make sure Ruby (>= v1.8) is installed.
 2. Install the hydeweb gem: `gem install hydeweb --pre`
 3. Build the site HTML files by typing: `hyde build`

 You may also type `hyde start` to serve the files in a local web server.

 (If #2 fails, you may need to type `sudo gem install hydeweb` instead)
